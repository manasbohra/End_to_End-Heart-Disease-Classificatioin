# End_to_End-Heart-Disease-Classificatioin 

This is Project based on a Classification problem which predicts whether or not a patient has heart disease based on their Clinical Parameters.
Uses a Pipeline which includes:
  1.Problem Definition
  2.Data
  3.Evaluation
  4.Features
  5.Modelling
  6.Experimentation

"MODELLING" brought about a lot of experimentation on which model best fits the problem statement to provide highest accuracy.
LogisticRegression was the Machine learning model used for this Classification problem.
